  caveats <<~EOS
    Linger is signed but not notarized, so macOS blocks its first launch.
    After the first install, open System Settings > Privacy & Security and
    choose "Open Anyway" for Linger. Upgrades should not need this again.

    Then click "Allow..." in Linger's menu and switch Linger on in
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. You only need to
    do this once.
