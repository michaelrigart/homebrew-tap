  caveats <<~EOS
    Hulder is signed but not notarized, so macOS blocks its first launch.
    After the first install, open System Settings > Privacy & Security and
    choose "Open Anyway" for Hulder. Upgrades should not need this again.

    Then allow Hulder under "Device Control and Data Access" in System
    Settings > Privacy & Security. Upgrades keep this permission; if macOS
    asks again, repeat it.

    To reorder menu bar items, open Hulder's Settings > Permissions, click
    "Allow reordering..." and pick the com.apple.MenuBar folder.
